Two variance component mixed linear models for genetic prediction in family data sets (described in the paper http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/17/016618)

The Matlab function pred2VC.m implements two-variance component prediction.
The Matlab function assoc2VC.m implements two-variance component association testing.

See the comments at the top of each file for details on how to call these functions.
